You should have a `index.html` and `main.css` file. See the HTML below for what you should start with!

Feel free to add colors and make your own page more intense if you want! I repeated content. Each READ MORE button should take you to some link on the internet.

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
  <title>Project: Week 2</title>
  <link rel="stylesheet" href="https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/normalize/8.0.0/normalize.css" />
  <link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Roboto" rel="stylesheet">
  <link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="main.css">
</head>
<body>
 YOUR HTML
